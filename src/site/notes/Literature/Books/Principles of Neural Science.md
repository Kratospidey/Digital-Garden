# Principles of Neural Science
## P1 - Overall Perspective
### 1 - The Brain and Behavior
The biological basis of consciousness and the processes by which we feel, act, learn, and remember are the ultimate challenges of the biological sciences. Advances in sequencing genes and inferring protein sequences have revealed similarities between proteins in the nervous system and those in the rest of the body, making it possible to establish a general plan for the function of cells. A unified approach to the study of behavior and neural science, in which the mind and body are not viewed as separate entities, rests on the view that all behavior is the result of brain function. Brain processes underlie all complex cognitive acts and behavior, and all behavioral disorders result from disturbances of brain function.

The task of neural science is to explain how the billions of nerve cells in the brain produce behavior and cognitive states and how those cells are influenced by the environment, including social experience. Neural science must continually confront fundamental questions such as whether a mental process is carried out in specific regions of the brain or involves the brain as a whole. Modern neural science describes language, a highly complex cognitive behavior, by focusing on the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain most highly developed in humans. The cortex is organized into functionally distinct regions, each made up of large groups of neurons, and the neural apparatus of a highly complex behavior can be analyzed in terms of the activity of specific sets of interconnected neurons within specific regions. Chapter 2 describes how neural circuits function at the cellular level using a simple reflex behavior to show how the interplay of sensory signals and motor signals culminate in a motor act.

#### Two Opposing Views Have Been Advanced on the Relationship Between Brain and Behavior
The views on nerve cells, the brain, and behavior that emerged in the 20th century are the result of a synthesis of five experimental traditions: anatomy, embryology, physiology, pharmacology, and psychology. The Italian Camillo Golgi and the Spaniard Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal produced detailed, accurate descriptions of nerve cells, discovering that nervous tissue is a network of discrete cells, not a syncytium. The neuron doctrine, which states that individual neurons are the elementary building blocks and signaling elements of the nervous system, was supported by American embryologist Ross Harrison and confirmed by electron microscopy. Physiological investigation of the nervous system began in the late 1700s, and modern electrophysiology grew out of the work of three German physiologists. Pharmacology demonstrated that drugs bind to discrete receptors typically located in the surface membrane of the cell. Psychological thinking about behavior dates back to ancient Greek philosophers and has evolved to include different perspectives such as dualism and monism. These traditions and discoveries have led to our current understanding of the nervous system and behavior.

#### The Brain Has Distinct Functional Regions
The central nervous system is composed of two main parts, the spinal cord and the brain, which is made up of seven major structures. Advances in radiographic imaging have allowed for the evaluation of metabolic activity in specific regions of the brain, providing evidence that specific behaviors are linked to certain regions of the brain. The cerebral cortex is responsible for cognitive abilities and is divided into frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, with each lobe having a specialized set of functions. The cortex is also divided into gyri and sulci, which are similar from person to person and have specific names. The organization of the cortex is characterized by each hemisphere being concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the contralateral side of the body, and although they appear similar, they are not completely symmetrical in structure or function.

#### The First Strong Evidence for Localization of Cognitive Abilities Came from Studies of Language Disorders
The first areas of the cortex that were identified as important for cognition were related to language. The discovery of these areas was made through the study of aphasia, a language disorder that occurs when certain areas of the brain tissue are destroyed by a stroke. The key figures in this discovery were Pierre Paul Broca, Gustav Fritsch, Eduard Hitzig, and Karl Wernicke. Broca identified specific areas of the brain concerned with language by correlating clinical evidence of aphasia with brain lesions discovered post mortem. He described the posterior region of the frontal lobe, now called Broca's area, as a crucial area for language production. Fritsch and Hitzig showed that characteristic limb movements of dogs could be produced by electrically stimulating discrete regions of the precentral gyrus. These regions were invariably located in the contralateral motor cortex, leading to the conclusion that the left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, is the dominant hemisphere. Wernicke described another type of aphasia, a failure of comprehension, in which the lesion occurred in the posterior part of the cortex where the temporal lobe meets the parietal and occipital lobes. On the basis of these discoveries, Wernicke formulated a neural model of language that attempted to reconcile and extend the two predominant theories of brain function at that time.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a new school of cortical localization arose in Germany, led by the anatomist Korbinian Brodmann. Using the cytoarchitectonic method, Brodmann distinguished 52 anatomically and functionally distinct areas in the human cerebral cortex. However, the aggregate-field view of the brain, which did not emphasize cellular connectionism, dominated experimental thinking and clinical practice until 1950.
several prominent neural scientists, including Lashley, Head, Goldstein, and Pavlov, who advocated for the aggregate-field view of the brain. Lashley, in particular, was skeptical of the cytoarchitectonic approach to functional mapping of the cortex, concluding that learning and other higher mental functions have no special locus in the brain and cannot be attributed to specific collections of neurons. He formulated the theory of mass action, according to which the full mass of the brain, not its regional components, is crucial to function.

Later studies showed that the maze-learning used by Lashley is unsuited to the search for local cortical functions because it involves so many motor and sensory capabilities. Besides, many mental functions are mediated by more than one region or neuronal pathway. Thus a given function may show anatomical redundancy and not be eliminated by a single lesion.

However, the evidence for localization of function became overwhelming in the late 1930s. Edgar Adrian in England and Wade Marshall and Philip Bard in the United States discovered that touching different parts of a cat's body elicits electrical activity in distinct regions of the cerebral cortex. By systematically probing the body surface, they established a precise map of the body surface in specific areas of the cerebral cortex described by Brodmann. This result showed that functionally distinct areas of the cortex can be defined unambiguously according to anatomical criteria such as cell type and cell layering, connections of cells, and behavioral function.

Studies using fMRI have provided further insight into the functional organization of Broca's area, which is responsible for processing grammatical rules of language. Researchers have found that processing of a second language occurs in a different region in Broca's area than that which processes the native language, and that the age at which a language is acquired is a significant factor in determining this organization. Additionally, fMRI studies have shown that Broca's area contains constraints that determine the structure of all natural languages. Studies of patients with brain damage have shown that cognitive processing for language occurs in the left hemisphere and is independent of pathways that process sensory and motor modalities used in language. These studies also highlight that spoken language represents only one of the language skills mediated by the left hemisphere.

#### Affective States Are Also Mediated by Local, Specialized Systems in the Brain
It was once believed that emotions were an expression of whole-brain activity, but recent studies have shown that specific neural systems are involved in regulating emotions. The right hemisphere of the brain is particularly important for processing affective aspects of language, such as intonation and emotional content. Patients with certain language disorders or epilepsy affecting affective states have provided valuable insights into the neural organization of emotion. Studies of patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy have also revealed characteristic emotional changes that resemble a coherent psychiatric syndrome. High-frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, part of the motor system, has been shown to improve the tremor characteristic of Parkinson's disease and induce unusual emotional states, such as euphoria and hilarity.

#### Mental Processes Are the End Product of the Interactions Between Elementary Processing Units in the Brain
The rejection of brain function localization can be attributed to the phrenologists, who introduced the concept without adequate evidence, imagining each region of the cerebral cortex as an independent mental organ. This theory was simplistic, and Flourens's rejection of phrenology, along with the ensuing dialectic between proponents of the aggregate-field view and the cellular connectionists, were responses to a theory without adequate experimental evidence. In the aftermath of Wernicke's discovery of the modular organization of language in the brain, we now think that all cognitive abilities result from the interaction of many processing mechanisms distributed in several regions of the brain. Specific brain regions are not responsible for specific mental faculties but instead are elementary processing units. The malfunction of a single pathway affects the information carried by it but need not disrupt the entire system, which can modify its performance to accommodate the breakdown of one pathway. The most astonishing example of the modular organization of mental processes is the finding that our very sense of self is achieved through the connection of independent circuits in our two cerebral hemispheres, each mediating its sense of awareness.
