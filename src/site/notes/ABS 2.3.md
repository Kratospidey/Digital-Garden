The paper identifies species at risk of local extinction due to megafires and proposes a method to identify those most affected by quantifying the spatial overlap between the 2019/2020 bushfires and native species habitat using species distribution models. The paper also proposes short-term recovery actions based on trait databases to identify potential mechanisms through which the megafire affected species of concern and the types of interventions potentially required. The species of immediate concern are those likely to experience local extinctions and those where those losses would have a strong negative impact on the long-term overall persistence of the species. The resulting database outlines the number of species of concern which would potentially benefit from post-fire intervention.
