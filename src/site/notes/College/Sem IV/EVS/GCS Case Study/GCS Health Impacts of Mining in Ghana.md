### Health Impacts Of Mining in Ghana
According to Ahern and Stephens, mining remains one of the most hazardous occupations in the world, both in terms of short-term injury and loss of life, but also due to long-term impacts such as cancers and respiratory conditions, including silicosis, asbestosis and pneumoconiosis

A catastrophe hit the people of Dunkwa-on-Offin in the central region where numerous people were buried in a “galamsey” pit when it caved in near the Ofin River Over miners perished in that single disaster. Reports stated that about “galamsey” machinists were working in the pit when the incident occurred on June. About bodies were recovered by the rescue operation that was hampered by gushing water from the Ofin River0 Another accident was recorded at Attaso, near Kotokuom in the Ashanti Region, where at least “galamsey” operators were trapped in a collapsed pit. Nine bodies were retrieved from the pit.

The Ghanaian Times reported an increase in cases of kidney diseases, and according to Dr. Amoako Atta (head of the renal unit of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital), the use of mercury by illegal miners is a contributory factor In a study conducted by the Centre for Environmental Impact Analysis, the occurrence of mercury in the environment was reported to be a result of its use in the gold recovery process where the inorganic form of the metal is either washed into rivers or readily vaporized into the atmosphere. The concentrations of mercury found in fish were three times higher than levels deemed safe by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). In addition, chemicals in the river can be harmful to the skin and the entire human body. Mercury affects the renal system, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system3 One report estimated that tons of mercury is released from small-scale mining operations in Ghana each year

A study in five selected communities (Sanso, Anyinam, Anyinamadokrom, Abombe and Tutuka, in the Obuasi Municipality) on mining activities near AngloGold Ashanti's operations and their health impact found that residents suffer from malaria, skin diseases, diarrhea, fever, colds and catarrh. Malaria accounted for about 2% of the diseases reported in the study, followed by respiratory infections 7%) and skin diseases 7%) Fever, diarrhea and other symptoms were reported by 3% of the respondents in the study area. The highest occurrence of colds or cough was at Anyinam 7% of responses), which is located very close to AngloGold Ashanti's open pit site where rock blasting and top soil removal with heavy machines are prevalent

Skin diseases were reported principally by workers and residents from Anyimadokrom 6% of responses) and Sanso 4% of responses). At Sanso, respondents noted that the prevalence of skin diseases was largely due to contamination of water bodies with chemicals which some residents are dependent on for water, food and other domestic purposes. The high occurrence of skin diseases at Anyimadokrom is due to its proximity to AngloGold Ashanti's Pompola treatment plant where chemicals such as arsenic (sulfur dioxide) are used At Abompe and Tutuka, located about km from active mine sites, with the exception of malaria, the occurrence of other diseases such as colds or coughs, skin diseases, fever and diarrhea were relatively low and this can be attributed to their distance from active mine sites.

In Ghana, the endemic nature of Buruli ulcer in communities adjacent to mining activities suggests that proximity to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a risk factor for this disease, as is the case of the higher prevalence of Buruli ulcer in the Amansie West District An increased risk of infection was not associated with direct participation in mining or contact with mine pit water in a case-control study in Ghana, but land use changes that often accompany ASGM activities such as streambed disturbances have been proposed as a mechanism for the spread of Buruli ulcer

A study conducted by Amposah-Tawia and Dartey-Baah found that most mining towns in Ghana harbor a number of commercial sex workers, some of whom travel to these towns in search of jobs, the lack of which compels them to turn to prostitution as a last resort Their study revealed a high number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases in the Wassa West District, the highest in the Western Region, due to the increased incidence of sex trade in the area. One possible explanation for this increased incidence is the high concentration of mining companies in the area.

Sociocultural and socioeconomic factors described in previous sections and in the social sciences and economics review suggest that members of ASGM communities may be especially vulnerable to HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections

The use of illicit drugs (marijuana and cocaine) as stimulants to enable workers to work longer and harder is also prevalent, particularly amongst AGSM miners in Ghana9 Other health and social impacts created by mining activities include hearing loss and silicosis, conditions generated by the blasting and drilling events with the resultant noise and dust, which have become irritants in mining regions The Ghana News Agency reported that sixteen “galamsey” operators, including two women at Kyekyewere, near Dunkwa, were confirmed dead when a portion of land caved in on them They were believed to have ignored warnings to stay away from a mining site which was being remediated. Hundreds of miners have died in Ghana as a direct consequence of poor safety conditions and uncontrolled digging of land at illegal mining operations
