### Social Impact

The 2001 cyanide spill in Tarkwa, Ghana had significant social impacts on the local community. The spill resulted in the release of an estimated 3,000 cubic meters of cyanide-contaminated water into the local environment, which affected nearby water sources used by local residents for drinking, irrigation, and other purposes. This caused a significant disruption to the livelihoods of local farmers and fishermen, as well as other members of the community who rely on these resources.

The incident also led to a decline in public trust in the mining company, as well as the government agencies responsible for overseeing mining activities in the region. This led to increased tensions between the community and the company, and a decline in support for mining activities in the area. The affected community also felt a lack of communication and transparency from the mining company and government agencies in addressing the issue, which further damaged their relationship.

The spill also caused a sense of fear, uncertainty and mistrust among community members, as they were not aware of the extent of the contamination, or the long-term effects of the spill. This resulted in a breakdown of the social fabric of the community, as people became more isolated and less willing to work together.

In general, the cyanide spill in Tarkwa had a detrimental effect on the social well-being of the local community, leading to mistrust, fear and a breakdown of community relations, as well as highlighting the need for better communication, transparency and community involvement in mining activities in Ghana.
