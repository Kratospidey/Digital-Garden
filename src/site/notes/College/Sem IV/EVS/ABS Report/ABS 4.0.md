The 2019/2020 megafires in southeastern Australia had a significant impact on biodiversity. The paper presents a framework that combines data on species vulnerability, distributions, and threats with a spatial conservation planning tool to identify conservation actions that could aid recovery from the fires and other threats. The use of spatial conservation planning tools can inform conservation responses to large-scale disturbances like megafires by identifying co-occurring threats that can be managed to improve species recovery. The framework can also inform post-fire biodiversity recovery management priorities in the medium and long term. The paper emphasizes the importance of adaptability in conservation planning and the need for such tools to incorporate disturbances and dynamic threats.
