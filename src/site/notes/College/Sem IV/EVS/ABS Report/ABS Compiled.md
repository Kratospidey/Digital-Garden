# Introduction
The paper discusses the impact of megafires, which are large and severe wildfires that require considerable resources to suppress and recover from. The author highlights that megafires are becoming more frequent due to climate change and that they can reshape biodiversity by causing mass mortality and the loss and redistribution of resources across vast areas. The article emphasizes that altered fire regimes threaten over 4,400 species with extinction across almost every continent on the globe, presenting an important challenge to conservation managers. The author suggests that rapidly quantifying the potential impacts of megafires and enacting conservation responses is essential to protect biodiversity and facilitate recovery in fire-prone ecosystems globally.
# Methods

## Study Region and the 2019/2020 Mega-fires
The paper covers the Victorian region of the 2019/2020 Australian megafires, which burned around 1.5 million hectares of forest, woodland, and alpine areas, along with patches of agricultural land. Wildfires are a regular disturbance in the region, with fire return intervals varying from every 5-20 years in lower elevation dry eucalypt forests to over 100 years in mesic eucalypt and rainforests. The 2019/2020 fire season was unprecedented and burnt more than 6 million hectares of temperate broadleaf forest and woodland across southeastern Australia, with three large wildfire complexes accounting for most of the area burnt in Victoria. The megafires were largely caused by record low fuel moisture levels and severe fire weather, driven by an extreme and prolonged drought. The paper uses mapped fire extent and severity mapping to understand the spatial variation in fire effects on biodiversity. The two highest fire severity classes are defined as "high severity fire," including areas where the canopy foliage has been largely consumed or scorched.

## Quantifying fire overlap with species distributions
The paper discusses the potential risk of local extinction for species with restricted ranges and those that are already threatened due to habitat loss caused by megafires. The authors identify the species most affected by quantifying the spatial overlap between the 2019/2020 bushfires and native species habitat using species distribution models across Victoria for ~4,200 taxa of terrestrial vertebrate fauna and vascular plants. They calculate the percentage of each species' habitat that fell within the boundary of the bushfires and weigh the percentage overlap by modelled habitat quality. The authors categorize species based on their conservation status and broad taxonomic/functional guild. The analysis is repeated by calculating the proportion of habitat burnt by high severity fire, which allowed the authors to assess which species were affected most acutely by the fire. Finally, the authors explore if species were disproportionately affected in areas of high-suitability habitat by calculating the proportion of habitat burnt by fire using high-threshold habitat distribution models.

## Identifying species of most immediate concern and candidate recovery actions
The paper identifies species at risk of local extinction due to megafires and proposes a method to identify those most affected by quantifying the spatial overlap between the 2019/2020 bushfires and native species habitat using species distribution models. The paper also proposes short-term recovery actions based on trait databases to identify potential mechanisms through which the megafire affected species of concern and the types of interventions potentially required. The species of immediate concern are those likely to experience local extinctions and those where those losses would have a strong negative impact on the long-term overall persistence of the species. The resulting database outlines the number of species of concern which would potentially benefit from post-fire intervention.

## Identifying cost-effective landscape-scale actions within the fire extent
The paper describes the use of a modified version of the spatial conservation action planning (SCAP) tool to identify the most cost-effective location-specific actions to undertake within and adjacent to the burned area after the 2019/2020 Victorian bushfires in Australia. SCAP combines distribution models for 19 threats and the ~4,200 species (terrestrial fauna and flora), with structured expert elicitation and machine learning techniques to generate species-specific maps of the expected benefits of management actions across Victoria. The tool considers the impacts of the fire on the habitat and species, and prioritizes actions that may benefit surviving or recolonizing native species. The adjustments made to the tool after the bushfires included reducing the expected net habitat available to each species in the absence of management actions by the proportion of their state-wide habitat burnt by severe fire and increasing the expected benefits of some actions within the fire extent to all species. The spatial adjustments to expected benefits were applied to all species except hollow-dependent fauna. The adjustments represent a general consensus that loss of suitable habitat increases extinction risk, native species may be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of feral animals and weeds after fire, and unburnt or less-severely burnt areas within fire-affected areas may be important refugia and sources of recovery following fire. The modified SCAP tool allowed a rapid assessment of the areas where post-fire management actions were mostly likely to be beneficial to biodiversity overall and most cost-effective, accounting for the distributions of thousands of species.

# Results
## Quantifying the overlap of fires with biodiversity values
The 2019/2020 megafires in Victoria, Australia overlapped with over 40% of the habitat of 346 species, including 45 threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act. More than 100 of these species had over 40% of their habitat affected by high severity fire, and some had almost all their range burnt. Even species with relatively low amounts of habitat in the fire extent had important habitat areas burnt, such as key breeding sites. Other biodiversity values affected by the fires are described in the Supplementary Material.

## Identifying species of immediate concern and candidate actions
The paper identifies 221 species of immediate concern due to the 2019/2020 megafires in Australia, including 154 flora and 67 vertebrate fauna species. 38 of these species are listed under the Federal Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 and 74 under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee (FFG) Act 1988. The paper also presents 11 threats related to the megafire and 21 candidate recovery actions that could be taken to ameliorate these threats. Threats such as direct mortality, loss of critical habitat features, and changes in the importance of other populations were identified for over 60 species, while at least 39 species were expected to be impacted by the loss of food resources. The impacts of invasive species through predation, herbivory, and competition were also identified as important threats.

## Identifying cost- effective landscape-scale actions within the fire extent
The SCAP identified controlling deer, predators, and weeds as highly cost-effective actions in the fire-affected region before the fires. Preliminary post-fire analysis suggests that these actions have become even more beneficial and cost-effective, as feral animals and weeds may severely inhibit post-fire recovery for many native species. Deer control, weed control, cat control, fox control, and pig control are likely to be cost-effective over large tracts of the burned area. The SCAP also identifies where within and adjacent to the burned areas these actions are likely to be most cost-effective, depending on where the biodiversity values represented will benefit most per unit cost. Unburned areas within and adjacent to the megafire extent and low severity burned areas were identified as high priority for action.

# Discussion
## Application to 2019/2020 Black Summer
The 2019/2020 megafires in southeastern Australia had a significant impact on biodiversity. The paper presents a framework that combines data on species vulnerability, distributions, and threats with a spatial conservation planning tool to identify conservation actions that could aid recovery from the fires and other threats. The use of spatial conservation planning tools can inform conservation responses to large-scale disturbances like megafires by identifying co-occurring threats that can be managed to improve species recovery. The framework can also inform post-fire biodiversity recovery management priorities in the medium and long term. The paper emphasizes the importance of adaptability in conservation planning and the need for such tools to incorporate disturbances and dynamic threats.

## Pre- and during-fire planning tools
The Australian megafires of 2019-2020 had a severe impact on many species, with over 346 species having more than 40% of their habitat burnt. The majority of affected species were flora, and high severity fires had significant conservation implications for individual species. To assist their recovery, 21 candidate recovery actions were identified, ranging from species-specific to landscape-scale actions. Species-specific actions aimed to increase survival and spread the risk of future megafires across multiple populations, while landscape-scale actions focused on invasive species management. Prioritizing actions post-fire and implementing ongoing landscape-scale predator management programs before fires occur will increase species' chances of recovery.

## Future development needs
The key to analyzing the impact of megafires on biodiversity is having a sound information base from which analyses can be performed, and conservation managers can build this now to better prepare for future megafires. This includes collating spatial information on where biodiversity is distributed, trait databases, and estimates of the relative effectiveness of conservation actions post-fire. Without these data, quantifying the possible effects of fires on biodiversity and identifying species of concern and candidate management actions is difficult. The paper outlines key datasets and information products that can be built by conservation managers in fire-prone biomes across the globe to assist in preparing conservation responses to future megafires. Species’ vulnerability to fire and expected responses to conservation actions are important pieces of information for identifying post-megafire actions. There are also uncertainties and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, and integrated monitoring programs that evaluate the success of post-fire actions for a broad range of species will provide important information in improving conservation responses. Moving towards representations of currently occupied habitat or temporally dynamic habitat suitability models will help guide post-fire conservation actions to locations that will have the greatest benefit.

## Concluding remarks
Climate change is intensifying multiple stochastic disturbances and threats to biodiversity that overlap in time and space, and altered fire regimes are emerging as a key threatening process for species across the globe (Kelly et al., 2020). Conservation managers increasingly require the capability and capacity to quantify the effects of actions, rapidly re-analyse options, and to redirect operational effort adaptively. Climate change requires managers to balance implementing rapid and reactive emergency responses to significant individual megafires, and considering how the consequences of recent and future events should influence long-term conservation planning. In the face of future mega-fires, rapid implementation of conservation actions may be required to give biodiversity the best chance of recovery. Standardized frameworks such as ours provide conservation managers with an approach that can be applied to future megafires in any ecosystem globally.
