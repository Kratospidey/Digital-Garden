The 2019/2020 megafires in Victoria, Australia overlapped with over 40% of the habitat of 346 species, including 45 threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act. More than 100 of these species had over 40% of their habitat affected by high severity fire, and some had almost all their range burnt. Even species with relatively low amounts of habitat in the fire extent had important habitat areas burnt, such as key breeding sites. Other biodiversity values affected by the fires are described in the Supplementary Material.
