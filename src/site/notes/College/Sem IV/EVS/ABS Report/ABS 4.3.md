The key to analyzing the impact of megafires on biodiversity is having a sound information base from which analyses can be performed, and conservation managers can build this now to better prepare for future megafires. This includes collating spatial information on where biodiversity is distributed, trait databases, and estimates of the relative effectiveness of conservation actions post-fire. Without these data, quantifying the possible effects of fires on biodiversity and identifying species of concern and candidate management actions is difficult. The paper outlines key datasets and information products that can be built by conservation managers in fire-prone biomes across the globe to assist in preparing conservation responses to future megafires. Speciesâ€™ vulnerability to fire and expected responses to conservation actions are important pieces of information for identifying post-megafire actions. There are also uncertainties and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, and integrated monitoring programs that evaluate the success of post-fire actions for a broad range of species will provide important information in improving conservation responses. Moving towards representations of currently occupied habitat or temporally dynamic habitat suitability models will help guide post-fire conservation actions to locations that will have the greatest benefit.
