The paper discusses the importance of maintaining up-to-date, spatially explicit biodiversity data for prioritizing species populations for management actions before or during extended fire events. This requires integrating genetic, trait, and population data to identify feasible candidates for intensive emergency management or extraction. With the integration of weather forecasting and fire behavior modeling, fire suppression agencies could model the risks of ongoing fires to biodiversity and justify targeted fire suppression efforts in high biodiversity value locations. Conservation managers need to routinely build disturbance into their decision support tools due to climate change, and future decision support products should explicitly integrate disturbance history when predicting species distributions or identifying cost-effective actions, especially for actions with costs and benefits that might be different in burned landscapes.
