The paper identifies 221 species of immediate concern due to the 2019/2020 megafires in Australia, including 154 flora and 67 vertebrate fauna species. 38 of these species are listed under the Federal Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 and 74 under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee (FFG) Act 1988. The paper also presents 11 threats related to the megafire and 21 candidate recovery actions that could be taken to ameliorate these threats. Threats such as direct mortality, loss of critical habitat features, and changes in the importance of other populations were identified for over 60 species, while at least 39 species were expected to be impacted by the loss of food resources. The impacts of invasive species through predation, herbivory, and competition were also identified as important threats.
