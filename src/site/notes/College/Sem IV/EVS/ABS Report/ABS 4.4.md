Climate change is intensifying multiple stochastic disturbances and threats to biodiversity that overlap in time and space, and altered fire regimes are emerging as a key threatening process for species across the globe (Kelly et al., 2020). Conservation managers increasingly require the capability and capacity to quantify the effects of actions, rapidly re-analyse options, and to redirect operational effort adaptively. Climate change requires managers to balance implementing rapid and reactive emergency responses to significant individual megafires, and considering how the consequences of recent and future events should influence long-term conservation planning. In the face of future mega-fires, rapid implementation of conservation actions may be required to give biodiversity the best chance of recovery. Standardized frameworks such as ours provide conservation managers with an approach that can be applied to future megafires in any ecosystem globally.
