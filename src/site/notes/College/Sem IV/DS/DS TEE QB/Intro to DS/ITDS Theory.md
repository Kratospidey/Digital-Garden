## Basic data types
### General Classification

    Integer;
    Character;
    Floating_Point;
    Double;
    end
    subgraph Enumerated Datatypes

    end
    subgraph Void Type
    Void_Type;
    end

| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- |

## Data structure definition
- Data structure is a data organisation, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification
- Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.


## Need for data structures
- A way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently
- The data items can be traversed easily.
- Provides efficiency, reusability and abstraction.
- Enhancing the performance of a program because the main function of the program is to store and retrieve the userâ€™s data as fast as possible.

## Classification of Data Structures
```mermaid
graph TD;
    Data_Structure-->Primitive_Data_Structure;
    Data_Structure-->Non_Primitive_Data_Structure;
    Non_Primitive_Data_Structure-->Linear;
    Linear-->Static;
    Linear-->Dynamic;
    Static-->Array;
    Dynamic-->Linked_List;
    Dynamic-->Stack;
    Dynamic-->Queue;
    Non_Primitive_Data_Structure-->Non_Linear;
    Non_Linear-->Tree;
    Non_Linear-->Graph;
```
## Operations on Data Structures
- Traverse
- Search
- Insert
- Delete
- Sort
- Merge
- Split
- Copy
## Abstract data type (ADT)
- An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure
- An ADT specifies:
	- Data stored
	- Operations on the data
	- Error conditions associated with operations

- Example: ADT modelling a simple stock trading system
- The data stored are buy/sell orders
- Operations supported are:
	- order buy(stock, shares, price)
	- order sell(stock, shares, price)
	- void cancel(order)
- Error Conditions:
	- Buy/sell a non-existent stock
	- Cancel a non-existent order

# Functions, Structures, and Pointers
## Function
### Function Declaration or Prototype
\[return_type] function_name( arg-type name-1,... , arg-type name-n);

### Function Definition
\[return_type] funtion_name( arg-type name-1,..., arg-type name-n)
	{
	 statements;
	}

### Function Call
- When a function is called, its stack frame is pushed onto the stack
- Then, the subroutine (function) instructions are executed
- Then, the stack frame of the function is popped from the stack
- Then the program goes back to the main stack using the address stored in the program counter
### Function Parameters
- You can either pass a parameter to a function or not
- If passing a parameter, there are two ways to do so:
	- Pass by value
	- Pass by reference
