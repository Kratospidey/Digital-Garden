The aim of this project was to create a particle simulator physics based game, in which players can interact with different types of particles and observe the physical interactions that occur between them. The game was designed to allow players to experiment with the various properties of different types of particles and to observe the outcomes of these interactions. The particle simulator physics based game was implemented using a computational approach and the results were obtained through simulations.

The game consists of a simulation environment in which players can add different types of particles, including Sand, Water, Stone, Oil, Fire, Steam, Smoke, Coal, Wood, Acid, Titan, Lava, Ash, Methane, Burning, Ice, Dirt, Seed, and Virus. The interactions between these particles are modeled using physical laws and the results of these interactions are displayed to the player in real-time.

The theoretical background of the project is rooted in the principles of physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. To accurately model the interactions between the different types of particles, a variety of mathematical constants and equations were used to describe the physical properties and behaviors of the particles. These equations were then implemented in the computational model used in the game, allowing players to observe the results of the interactions between the particles in real-time.

In conclusion, this project represents a comprehensive examination of the interactions between different types of particles in a physics-based simulation environment. The results of the project provide valuable insights into the properties and behaviors of different types of particles and demonstrate the feasibility of using computational models to simulate physical interactions.
