To assist mining companies and regulatory authorities in the control of cyanide spills and its impacts, the following measures are recommended:

1. To improve public awareness of environmental safety and risks of mining operations, regulatory authorities should mount programs  to bridge the knowledge gap between the mining companies and the local communities. Community relations and focused support for the communities by mining companies is also vital.

2. Inspections conducted at mine sites by regulatory bodies often become routine, and critical assessments are not carried out. Critical inspection of containment sites, together with improved designs, would go a long way to reduce spills from containment areas.

3. Detoxification by alkaline chlorination is known to introduce into the environment compounds toxic to aquatic life, and should not be the first option, unless there is adequate information on the soil types at the spill sites to indicate that the detoxification would not compound the impact.

4. Detoxification using hydrogen peroxide appears to be the most environmentally friendly method among the current known technologies. Unlike other cyanide destruction methods, oxidation of cyanide with hydrogen peroxide is a fast, one-step reaction, neither forming toxic intermediates nor substantially increasing the total dissolved solids concentration. Excess hydrogen peroxide decomposes to water and oxygen.

5. Though more expensive, use of this method exclusively for both routine and emergency detoxification would reduce the impact of cyanide in the vicinity of mining sites
