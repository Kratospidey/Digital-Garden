### Economic Impact

The 2001 cyanide spill in Tarkwa, Ghana had significant economic impacts on the local community. The spill occurred at the Tarkwa mine, which is operated by Gold Fields Ghana Limited, a subsidiary of South Africa-based Gold Fields Limited.

The spill resulted in the release of an estimated 3,000 cubic meters of cyanide-contaminated water into the local environment, which affected nearby water sources used by local residents for drinking, irrigation, and other purposes. This caused a significant disruption to the livelihoods of local farmers and fishermen, as well as other members of the community who rely on these resources for their income. Many local farmers lost their crops and fish stocks as a result of the spill, leading to a loss of income and financial hardship.

Additionally, the spill led to widespread public health concerns, as cyanide is a highly toxic chemical that can cause a variety of health problems when ingested or inhaled. This led to increased medical expenses for local residents and a decline in productivity as many were unable to work due to health issues.

The incident also led to a decline in public trust in the mining company, as well as the government agencies responsible for overseeing mining activities in the region. This led to decreased support for mining activities in the area, which also had an impact on the local economy.

In general, the cyanide spill in Tarkwa had a detrimental effect on the economic well-being of the local community, leading to a loss of income, increased medical expenses and a decline in support for mining activities in the area, which resulted in a negative impact on the local economy.
