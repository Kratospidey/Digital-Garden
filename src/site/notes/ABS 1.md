The paper discusses the impact of megafires, which are large and severe wildfires that require considerable resources to suppress and recover from. The author highlights that megafires are becoming more frequent due to climate change and that they can reshape biodiversity by causing mass mortality and the loss and redistribution of resources across vast areas. The article emphasizes that altered fire regimes threaten over 4,400 species with extinction across almost every continent on the globe, presenting an important challenge to conservation managers. The author suggests that rapidly quantifying the potential impacts of megafires and enacting conservation responses is essential to protect biodiversity and facilitate recovery in fire-prone ecosystems globally.
