The paper describes the use of a modified version of the spatial conservation action planning (SCAP) tool to identify the most cost-effective location-specific actions to undertake within and adjacent to the burned area after the 2019/2020 Victorian bushfires in Australia. SCAP combines distribution models for 19 threats and the ~4,200 species (terrestrial fauna and flora), with structured expert elicitation and machine learning techniques to generate species-specific maps of the expected benefits of management actions across Victoria. The tool considers the impacts of the fire on the habitat and species, and prioritizes actions that may benefit surviving or recolonizing native species. The adjustments made to the tool after the bushfires included reducing the expected net habitat available to each species in the absence of management actions by the proportion of their state-wide habitat burnt by severe fire and increasing the expected benefits of some actions within the fire extent to all species. The spatial adjustments to expected benefits were applied to all species except hollow-dependent fauna. The adjustments represent a general consensus that loss of suitable habitat increases extinction risk, native species may be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of feral animals and weeds after fire, and unburnt or less-severely burnt areas within fire-affected areas may be important refugia and sources of recovery following fire. The modified SCAP tool allowed a rapid assessment of the areas where post-fire management actions were mostly likely to be beneficial to biodiversity overall and most cost-effective, accounting for the distributions of thousands of species.
